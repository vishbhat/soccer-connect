# soccer-connect
Soccer Connect is a social soccer network that allows players and teams to connect with each other. It is quite a tedious job to look for teams physically and be part of them, similarly, it is difficult for the teams as well to find their best fit player. Soccer Connect is a social internet platform that allows players to find their dream team from the available list of teams posted on the portal. It also allows teams to find the various players registered on the portal and request the players to join their teams.
